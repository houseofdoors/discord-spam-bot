# discord spam bot
 A command line discord spam bot which sends a message every second. The user chooses the message, which can be any length.
 I got the idea for 'Automate the Boring Stuff with Python', although I was so concerned with whether I could, I forgot to ask whether I should.
This is my first proper, completed project, so please let me know how I can improve my code.
